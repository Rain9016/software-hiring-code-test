# Coding Test
This document outlines the coding test that we request you undertake at Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering at the University of New South Wales.

## Foreword
This test is not about building a complete system, it's about giving you the chance to showcase your skills, demonstrate problem solving, and translating a user story into a system that delivers the customers’ demands. The user story will be in context of what you will be doing at UNSW.

## Instructions
1. Create the necessary github repositories.
2. Complete the Code Challenge.
3. Email the hiring Point of Contact with the URLs of the repositories.

## The Tech Stack
You are free to use any tools you believe will give you a balance of speed to complete and ability to demonstrate your skillset. We are, however, a React/Redux+ frontend that sits on C#/Nodejs backends. Bonus points will be awarded if it works in a docker file. Please also commit your code using git, we would like to access the evolution of the code.

# Challenge
## User Story

The clinicians will be monitoring the patients from a portal. This portal needs to be able to showcase where each patient is within their house in (reasonable) real-time. When a patient enters a specified room, an alert can be shown on screen that notifies clinicians of a message. Simplify put, an occupation-based alert,e.g.. "Patient {name} has entered the living room." or "Patient {name} is entering kitchen, you should contact them."
The backend is getting information from an external source of a patients location within their house, which can change over time.
## Questions
After you've finished the solution, we would like you complete a few questions. Put the answers in the readme of your submission.
1. If you had more time, what would you change or focus more time on?
2. Which part of the solution consumed the most amount of time?
3. What would you suggest to the customer that they may not have thought of in regards to their request?
## Note
You don't need to develop a real login authentication system, though points if you do. We would like to see the user flow for one.

We don't mind if the data is mocked (faked), but we would like you demonstrate what the relationship between the server and end user looks like.

If you’re going to use a stack that has some setup steps, please use the readme to document the steps.
